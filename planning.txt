-- Planning for space match 3.0 --

TODO's
- mod coloring, maybe even match score coloring, maybe difficulty coloring
- all caps menu titles
- find a way to highlight the score that player just got when doing high scores
- add a no refill option or game type
- use .. for string concat instead of all the string formats
- Make the default score file nicer
- play the game a bunch and look for bugs or undesirable behaviour
- finalize the working and features of the game for now so that it can be released
    even if you work on refactoring it for a better code base.
- standardize the presentation of your code so each file has a consistent style
- refactor your larger functions into several smaller functions for ease of
    understanding and maintainability.
- think about where things are located and if you can make some sense of putting
    them in better places do it.
- Consider creating a view module for all the screen areas to be left in. They
    could then be accesed in any file without having to redeclare them or find
    perfect places for them in each state.
