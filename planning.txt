Planning for Space match 3000


-- Refactoring --

TODO
- Add an abstraction for the screen and possibly for areas on the screen. The
    code for drawing a screen should be like Jpanel in swing. it has a main
    element that you subclass for each panel of the screen you want to draw on
    then it has the ability to put multiple panels into a window. My thought
    would be that since the window is only one and created by love that I could
    just come up with a main screen that will represent what is contained in that
    top level space and then split it up with other areas that can represent drawn
    areas. The main difference is that the screen is not what is being drawn to
    but simply organizing code for a rendering of the space in the window. This
    could either be done with creating a screen that can hold muliple screens or
    with a screen to represent the whole window and a screen area for each part
    of the screen that can be drawn on. The areas will be able to overlap. If it
    was java then the screens and areas would all be subclasses that would be
    able to be used whenever they were needed. This is what I would think to do
    for the screen but not for indivdual areas. the areas could hold code for
    drawing specific things to the screen and that way create a little bit of
    seperation for the drawing code. later if the view were to change the only
    code that would need to change would be the screen area implementation of
    its draw functions.
